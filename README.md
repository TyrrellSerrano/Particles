# Particles

This computer app is a simple game designed to be played by two people. 

Interaction:
Using a  ps4 controller, one player uses the "square" and "circle" buttons to fire particles at the other player. These pink and orange particles are aimed using the left joystick. The other player uses the mouse to controll the sphere and avoid the particles. As the mouse-player gets hit, the sphere will start to dissapear. When the sphere is gone, the game is over. To start, open "Particles" in max & select your desired connected controller.

Scripting:
While this application could have been built purely in Max, I chose to use Javascript to create Max objects & control the interactions.
